# COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Classification – Hybrid VGG16 + ResNet50 Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that builds and evaluates a **hybrid deep-learning model** combining **VGG16** and **ResNet50** for COVID-19 chest X-ray detection.  
The project demonstrates end-to-end preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Overview

The notebook walks through:

- Loading and preprocessing chest X-ray image data  
- Building a **hybrid CNN architecture** combining VGG16 and ResNet50 feature extractors  
- Adding custom dense layers for classification  
- Training with data augmentation  
- Evaluating accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, and predictions  
- Saving the trained model for later inference  

This project aims to explore how hybrid deep-learning models can enhance medical image classification accuracy.
